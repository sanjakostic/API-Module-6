In both WeatherPy and VacationPy projects, pandas was used to handle weather and city data, gathered using the Geoapify API. Matplotlib was used in creating visualizations such as scatter plots to illustrate the relationships between weather variables and latitude in WeatherPy.

For data retrieval, I made requests to the OpenWeatherMap API in WeatherPy and the Geoapify API in VacationPy. These APIs returned weather data and information about hotels near selected cities, respectively. Additionally, I used SciPy's linregress function in WeatherPy for linear regression. In VacationPy I used hvPlot for interactive map visualizations.

The most challenging thing was getting the parameters for the functions such as the API calls and the visualizations correct.
